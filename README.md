# olcaoPy #

The python library for the OLCAO package.

This library is currently under heavy developement and pruning. The goals are to:

* replace the perl glue code currently in use in the OLCAO package
* provide a large set of package agnostic tools for use by condensed matter physicists.

This software is Free. Do with it what you like. I am not responsible for any bugs!
